# House Price Prediction
Developing a regression model using Ridge and Lasso methods for a US-based housing company named Surprise Housing. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.


## General Information
To enter the Australian Market company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and how well those variables describe the price of a house.

Datasets : House price data set

## Conclusions

From my analysis the model perform more better when with ridge regression model as compared to that of Lasso Regression. This determines that all the categorical and numeric parameters are equally important to predict the prices of houses of Australia.
